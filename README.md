# CBPFVG: Custom Button Prompts For Various Games

Sometimes, I make small mods to games to integrate custom button prompts!  
I've decided to share these because open-source is poggers <sup>`i am not sorry for that`</sup>

## Games I've done this to

> [Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance (PC)](#metal-gear-rising-revengeance-pc)  
> [~~Metroid: Other M (Wii)~~](#metroid-other-m-wii) | **Unfinished!!**

### Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance (PC)
>[install/uninstall](MGRR/MGRR_Installation.md) | [dev documentation](MGRR/research/MGRR_Documentation.md)

Installation difficulty: **extremely easy**  
Supported Controllers:
* Nintendo Switch Pro Controller/Dual Joy-Con
  * The only difference between the two is the D-Pad sprite; NS Pro has its D-Pad while Dual Joy-Cons have the split D-Buttons.
  * Minor Issue: B is confirm in menus, while A is back.
    >Basically unfixable; unfortunately, you just have to Deal With It.
  * Cosmetic issue: Config screen shows buttons but not the controller.
     >This is because the only options I had were either a DualShock 3, or an Xbox 360 controller; I chose neither.  
     >If you think you can design a texture for the NS Pro or Dual Joy-Con **that matches the style of the existing 360/DS3 textures,** shoot me a message.
  * ~~Steam Deck~~ -- **Untested, as I don't own a Steam Deck!**
    * Changes LB/RB/LT/RT to L1/L2/R1/R2.

### ~~Metroid: Other M (Wii)~~ | **Unfinished!!**

~~Provides a pretty seamless experience; quite complicated so I gave it [**its own repo.**](https://github.com/NoriLynnfield/OtherM-BetterControls)  
Installation Difficulty: Hard  
Supported Controllers:~~
* ~~Nintendo Switch Pro Controller~~
* ~~Xbox One/Series Controllers~~
* ~~Steam Deck | **On hold until I actually own a Steam Deck!**~~
