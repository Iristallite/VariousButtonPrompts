[install](#installation-instructions) | [uninstall](#uninstallation-instructions) | [supported controllers](#supported-controllers)

### Installation Instructions

1. [Download](https://github.com/NoriLynnfield/CBPFVG/releases/tag/mgrr) the `.zip` file corresponding to [your controller.](#supported-controllers)
2. Copy the `ui` folder from the downloaded `.zip` file to the `GameData` folder in *MGRR*'s installation directory.
  >IMPORTANT STEP FOR STEAM INPUT USERS WITH SWITCH CONTROLLERS: Make sure your face buttons correspond to a **_positional XInput_** mapping.
3. Start *MGRR* and check if the prompts match your controller.

### Uninstallation Instructions

1. Go to *MGRR*'s installation directory.
2. Enter the `GameData` folder.
3. Delete the `ui` folder.

### Supported Controllers:
* Nintendo Switch Pro Controller/Dual Joy-Con
  * The only difference between the two is the D-Pad sprite; NS Pro has its D-Pad while Dual Joy-Cons have the split D-Buttons.
  * Minor Issue: B is confirm in menus, while A is back.
    >Basically unfixable; unfortunately, you just have to Deal With It.
  * Cosmetic issue: Config screen shows buttons, but not the controller.
     >This is because the only options I had were either a DualShock 3, or an Xbox 360 controller; I chose neither.  
     >If you think you can design a texture for the NS Pro or Dual Joy-Con **that matches the style of the existing 360/DS3 textures,** shoot me a message.
